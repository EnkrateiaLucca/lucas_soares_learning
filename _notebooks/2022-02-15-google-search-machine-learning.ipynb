    "***In this article I want to share 9 tips for how to perform advanced google searches for machine learning***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Searching machine learning papers after a certain date\n",
    "\n",
    "`site: arxiv.org machine learning after:2020`\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Searching papers that mention a specific word or sentence within a specific interval date\n",
    "\n",
    "`site: arxiv.org \"artificial general intelligence 2019..2022\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Searching repositories that use a specific framework\n",
    "\n",
    "`site: github.com \"pytorch\" *& \"RNN\" after: 2020`\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Searching tools of a certain type\n",
    "\n",
    "`image annotation tool & \"open source\" after:2018`\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Searching Images of a Certain Size and Type\n",
    "`image:panda imagesize:256x256`\n",
    " \n",
    " ## 6. Search social media & hashtags\n",
    "\n",
    "`@twitter transformers & #artificialintelligence`\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Search for a price of GPUs or Hardware in ML\n",
    "\n",
    "`GPU $600`\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Exclude topics from a search with \"-\" operator\n",
    "\n",
    "Put `-` in front of a word you want to leave out. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "``\"cloud provider\" & \"machine learning\" -Azure -\"Google Cloud\" -AWS`\n",
    "\n",
    "(also search for without the exclude terms to show the difference)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Search for related sites\n",
    "\n",
    "Put \"`related:`\" in front of a web address you already know. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "`related:kaggle.com`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other important operators:\n",
    "- `filetype:` to search specific file types\n",
    "- `intitle:` to search websites whose title contains a certain keyword\n",
    "- `inurl:` to search websites containing a certain search term in the url\n",
    "- `intext:` to search for websites containing a certain search term in the text\n",
    "- `info:` to find information about a specific page\n",
    "\n",
    "# Just Google It!\n",
    "\n",
    "Any experienced developer in the machine learning field or anywhere else will\n",
    "tell you that for pretty much any task, question or concern you have: \"Just google\n",
    "it!\". Developing this skill is a must to boost your ability to self-learn \n",
    "complicated topics that require the combination of a lot of information.\n",
